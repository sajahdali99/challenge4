## Challenge 4

### Task: Write a Playbook that can install and run Docker

<details><b><summary>What was the Challenge?</b></summary>
<p>

>The challenge this week was to use Ansible to automate a playbook in order to install and run docker on the local machine.
</p>
</details>

<details><b><summary>How I expected the challenge to go</b></summary>
<p>
  
>I expected the challenge to be a fairly simple one. I felt competant all week in my ability to write a .yaml file and anything I did not know I was able to refer to the demos provided.
</p>
</details>

<details><b><summary>What went well?</b></summary>
<p>
  
>I immediantly understood the task which is a strong contrast to the earlier challenges as I would struggle at first glance before as I was not used to these types of challenges. I have become more confident in the application of the skills that I have learnt in the past few weeks and this is reflected in how much easier I found this weeks challenge.
</p>
</details>

<details><b><summary>What did not go as planned?</b></summary>
<p>
  
>Actually getting the playbook.yaml to run without failure was a challenge I checked the code very carefully however checking with my cohorts we found that identical playbooks ran perfectly on their vm. It maybe my vm was not configured correctly.
</p>
</details>

<details><b><summary>Possible improvements for future challenge</b></summary>
<p>
  
>In future I would check that the VM and Ansible software is correctly configured. If their was more I am confident that I would of solved the issue, time today was also taken with a number of weekly meetings that were scheduled throughout the day coupled with vpn issues.
